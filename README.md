# How to Install

You need to install `rcm` first.

## Fedora

```
$ sudo dnf install rcm
```

## Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt install rcm
```

# Use the Dot Files

It's not mandatory but it's recommended to clone the repo like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/QSaman/DotFiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then run `bootstrap.sh` script. For more information visit this [link](https://fedoramagazine.org/managing-dotfiles-rcm/).
